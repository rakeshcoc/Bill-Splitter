# Bill-Splitter
About Project:

The purpose of this application is to provide an
easy and fair way to resolve the problem of splitting a bill or several
bills between a group of people. All the concerned parties would
connect to the server using their individual PCs and enter all the
places where and how much, they spent the money which can be
seen by all others in their PCs. Once a person is done sending all the
details of his expenditure for the group, he can ask the server to split
the bill, to inform server that all his expenditures are done. This way
once all the connected parties ask the server to split the bill the server
does the required calculations and sends every person how much
money he should pay/get from which person and all confusion,
discussions and hassle of calculation can be avoided.

Further information regarding project and it's setup is available in Documentation folder.
